Project name: 

Placyk.pl


Description:

The goal of the project is to help parents and their children to find company to enjoy time at a playground. The idea comes stright from experience, which seems to be not only mine, but also of a much bigger group of people:)

As parents we usually donâ€™t fond of spending a half of our spare time at playgrounds, but, since we love our children, we do this. We swing, slide, take a roundabout, play hide and seek and make three thousand nine hundred twenty four sand castles. Per week.
Usually such situation looks much better if we have two helpers:

1. company for our children,
2. company for ourselves.

The application is just a small local teaser (backend part with a little help of Bootstrap) of how parents could organize themselves to find out at which playground they can expect company and, at a same time, inform other users about their choice (which is a basis for other parents to make a decision where to go).

Technologies used:
- Python/Django
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript/jQuery 

Despite it's my first Django project I hope you can enjoy not only the idea, but also quality of performance. I would really appreciate if you could join the project or just leave your comments.
